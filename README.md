# Use
- Use the "UNITE" keyword in STAT_NON_LINE/AFFICHAGE (use UNITE 29)
- Execute Plot_Instants.sh and Plot_Residuals in ASTK

# Configuration in ASTK

0) Allow Plot_Instants.sh executing as program
1) Go to Tools-->Parameters --> New Tool
2) Put tool name (example Plot Time of computation)
3) In command line box put the full path of the Plot_Instants.sh
4) Click in OK

Repeat steps to Plot_Residuals
